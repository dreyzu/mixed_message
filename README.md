# Mixed Message

Hello, this program is a message generator.

Every time you run this script you will get a new randomized output.

You'll need Node.js installed on your computer to run it in your terminal:

[Install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

Then, type:

```sh
$ node script.js
```

This is a project from Codecademy.
Have fun :smile:
